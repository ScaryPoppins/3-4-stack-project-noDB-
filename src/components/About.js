          This website is dedicated to the wonderful people who spend their lives giving to others less fortunate then themselves.  
          These unsung heros dedicate their lives to putting a smile to children's faces.  Their selflessness should inspire us all.

        Charity Vans &copy; &reg; was created to give like-minded charitible people a place to gather and discuss their vans and their strategy to lure people into having a brighter day with their free wares.
        We wanted to give back to those who are so giving to others.   The forums are coming soon.  Until then, please enjoy the For Sale section and meet up with others at one of our Charity events.
